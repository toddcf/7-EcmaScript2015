// ES2015 (short for ECMAScript 2015) is the official name for the new version of JavaScript.
// However, everyone just calls it ES6, because it came after ES5.
// ES5 is currently supported in all modern browsers.
// ES6 has partial support in modern browsers, and no support in older browsers.
// ES2016 is already out, but has almost no browser support at this time.
// Use a transpiler that converts ES6 code back to ES5 to ensure browser support.


// Variable Declaractions: LET and CONST

// ES5:

// Variables declared in ES5 are "function scoped," which means they can be changed.
/*
var name5 = "Jane Smith";
var age5 = 23;
name5 = "Jane Miller";
console.log(name5);

// ES6:

// Variables declared in ES6 are "block scoped," and use either LET or CONST.
// let is like var, and can be changed later.
// const is for values we don't want to change.

const name6 = "Jane Smith";
let age6 = 23;
// This won't work:
name6 = "Jane Miller";
console.log(name6);
