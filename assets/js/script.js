// ES2015 (short for ECMAScript 2015) is the official name for the new version of JavaScript.
// However, everyone just calls it ES6, because it came after ES5.
// ES5 is currently supported in all modern browsers.
// ES6 has partial support in modern browsers, and no support in older browsers.
// ES2016 is already out, but has almost no browser support at this time.
// Use a transpiler that converts ES6 code back to ES5 to ensure browser support.
